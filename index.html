      <h1>How to Ask Questions</h1>
      <p>
        Effective questions lead to effective answers. Clear and precise
        questions increase the chances of receiving fast and accurate responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're frustrated by a lack of help, consider how your question might
        be perceived. Effective communication is a two-way street, and following
        these guidelines can improve your responses.
      </p>
      <h2>Be Clear and Specific</h2>
      <p>
        Clearly state your problem. Include specific details like error
        messages, expected behaviour, and actual results.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "I'm using Python 3.8 on Windows 10. When I run my script to read a
          JSON file, I get a 'FileNotFoundError'. The file exists in the same
          directory as my script."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Provide Context and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Explain the context of your problem. Mention relevant software versions,
        operating systems, and any background information that can help others
        understand your situation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "I'm developing a web application using React and TypeScript. When
          compiling, I receive a type error in my 'App.tsx' file."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>State Your Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Describe what you're trying to achieve, not just the problem you're
        facing. This provides context, avoids
        <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">The XY Problem</a>, and may lead to
        better solutions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "I want to optimise my SQL query to improve performance for large
          datasets. Currently, the query takes over 10 seconds to run."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Show What You've Tried</h2>
      <p>
        List the steps you've already taken to solve the problem. This prevents
        repeated suggestions and shows that you've made an effort to find a
        solution.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "I've checked that the file path is correct and that the file exists.
          I also tried running the script with administrative privileges, but
          the error persists."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Use Clear Language</h2>
      <p>
        Use straightforward language, and check your spelling and grammar. Avoid
        jargon or abbreviations that might not be understood by everyone. It
        shows respect for the reader and increases the likelihood of getting the
        response you need.
      </p>
      <h2>Be Polite and Respectful</h2>
      <p>
        Courtesy encourages others to help you. Use polite expressions like
        "please" and "thank you," and acknowledge any assistance you receive.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "Thank you for your help. I appreciate the time you've taken to assist
          me."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Be Open to Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        When someone offers assistance or suggestions, listen carefully and
        consider their advice. Be open to the possibility that you may need to
        approach the problem differently.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "I hadn't considered that angle, that's a good point. I'll try
          implementing it that way. Thank you for the suggestion."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Follow Up with the Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Let others know if their suggestions worked. This helps everyone learn
        and contributes to the community.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "Updating the library fixed the issue. Thanks for pointing me in the
          right direction!"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Practice Patience</h2>
      <p>
        Understand that others may need time to respond. Avoid sending multiple
        messages if you don't receive an immediate reply.
      </p>
      <h2>Don't Take Criticism Personally</h2>
      <p>
        If someone offers constructive criticism, use it as an opportunity to
        learn. Stay positive and focus on finding a solution.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Example:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "Thank you for highlighting that issue. I'll make those changes and
          see if it helps."
        </p>
