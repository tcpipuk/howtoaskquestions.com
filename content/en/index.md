# How to Ask Questions

Effective questions lead to effective answers. Clear and precise questions increase the chances of
receiving fast and accurate responses.

If you're frustrated by a lack of help, consider how your question might be perceived. Effective
communication is a two-way street, and following these guidelines can improve your responses.

## Be Clear and Specific

Clearly state your problem. Include specific details like error messages, expected behaviour, and actual results.

> **Example:**  
> "I'm using Python 3.8 on Windows 10. When I run my script to read a JSON file,
> I get a 'FileNotFoundError'. The file exists in the same directory as my script."

## Provide Context and Background

Explain the context of your problem. Mention relevant software versions, operating systems, and any
background information that can help others understand your situation.

> **Example:**  
> "I'm developing a web application using React and TypeScript.
> When compiling, I receive a type error in my 'App.tsx' file."

## State Your Goal

Describe what you're trying to achieve, not just the problem you're facing. This provides context,
avoids [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/), and may lead to better solutions.

> **Example:**  
> "I want to optimise my SQL query to improve performance for large datasets.
> Currently, the query takes over 10 seconds to run."

## Show What You've Tried

List the steps you've already taken to solve the problem. This prevents repeated suggestions and
shows that you've made an effort to find a solution.

> **Example:**  
> "I've checked that the file path is correct and that the file exists.
> I also tried running the script with administrative privileges, but the error persists."

## Use Clear Language

Use straightforward language, and check your spelling and grammar. Avoid jargon or abbreviations
that might not be understood by everyone. It shows respect for the reader and increases the
likelihood of getting the response you need.

## Be Polite and Respectful

Courtesy encourages others to help you. Use polite expressions like "please" and "thank you," and
acknowledge any assistance you receive.

> **Example:**  
> "Thank you for your help. I appreciate the time you've taken to assist me."

## Be Open to Feedback

When someone offers assistance or suggestions, listen carefully and consider their advice. Be open
to the possibility that you may need to approach the problem differently.

> **Example:**  
> "I hadn't considered that angle, that's a good point.
> I'll try implementing it that way. Thank you for the suggestion."

## Follow Up with the Outcome

Let others know if their suggestions worked. This helps everyone learn and contributes to the
community.

> **Example:**  
> "Updating the library fixed the issue. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!"

## Practice Patience

Understand that others may need time to respond. Avoid sending multiple messages if you don't
receive an immediate reply.

## Don't Take Criticism Personally

If someone offers constructive criticism, use it as an opportunity to learn. Stay positive and
focus on finding a solution.

> **Example:**  
> "Thank you for highlighting that issue. I'll make those changes and see if it helps."
